            <p>Eniye could see houses swallowed up by the high level of water. She wondered what would happen to the properties of the people affected by the flood crises.
‘Mummy, what causes flooding? Why were these people not aware of the flood?’
Her mother sighed. ‘ Several things can cause flooding. It usually starts with heavy rainfall, but unusual high tides, tsunamis due to undersea earthquakes, breaks or failures of dams, levees, retention ponds or lakes and other infrastructure that retains water can also cause floods.’
</p>
            <p>‘Does that mean we cannot prevent rain and flood, mummy?’ Eniye pressed.
‘Well, of course, Rain is God’s gift to us and so we cannot stop it. However, flooding can be prevented. It is the duty of both the Government and the individuals to create and implement the plans. While the government creates a good drainage system for excess water to escape, it is the duty of the citizens not to clog it with our bottles and waste. We must dispose of our waste properly, if not, the Government’s effort will be a waste.
</p>
            <p>Another way to prevent floods is by using GREEN ROOFS. Green roofs are roofs that are covered with plants and vegetation. With this, when the rains fall, the roofs absorb the water. The most important aspect is that it is the responsibility of everybody to adapt to climate change.’
</p>
            <p>Eniye was glad she had learned about flooding and the environment but she was sad to see children like her displaced and suffering.
‘Mum, how can we support them?’
</p>
            <p>‘That is a very great question’ Eniye’s mum said. ‘This is the question everyone is supposed to be asking. We must not leave it to the Government alone to handle. There are a couple of NGOs volunteering to help the people who are affected and displaced. These displaced people are put in places we call IDPs. An IDP or an Internally Displaced Camp is usually a safe shelter for displaced persons, where they are protected and taken care of before they eventually move back to their homes. People can donate money, food items and even clothes to these NGOs to help the affected flood victims.’
</p>
            <p>
        Eniye joined her mother in the living room to watch the 7 pm news after she was done with her assignment. Eniye was surprised to see the water and floods destroying many states in the country. While watching the news, Eniye's mother told her how she was a survivor of a flood when she was young. It was at night when the rain started pouring heavily, and the water level rose fast. She said that she had to swim for her life and was rescued by an old man who lived across from them. The newscaster named Bayelsa, Anambra, Cross River, Delta, and Kano as the most states affected by the flooding crisis.
            </p>
            <p>‘This is great mum, can I donate some of my clothes to them?’ Eniye asked.
‘Yes, my dear, tomorrow, we will do that. You are really a good girl.’ Eniye’s mum replied as she hugged her.</p>
